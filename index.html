              <h4>Rob Sullivan</h4>
            </div>
            <p>In the world of web development, relational databases can often take on the stigma of a technology dinosaur. Postgres turns this trend on its head by being a fast, reliable and extensible datastore of love. In this session, we'll look at how Postgres stays relevant with features, embraces NoSQL concepts and works with your code to live App'ily ever after.</p>

              <h4>Jeff French</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Are you excited about all the mobile technologies available today but you can’t decide which language to learn? Is your company planning to build a mobile app but you can’t decide which platform to invest in first? The answer is simple: don’t choose! In this session I will show you how you can use the PhoneGap framework to build an app using just HTML, Javascript and CSS that will compile to a native app. Along the way, I’ll point out various performance tips, helper libraries and design patters to make your app experience awesome on all devices. Your app will be ready for submission to each platform’s app store and will install and run natively all from a single code base!</p>

            <p>In this talk, we'll focus on what developers need to know to take advantage of JavaScriptCore bindings in iOS 7. We will also explore where this new technology fits in alongside existing JavaScript solutions for mobile development, like Appcelerator's Titanium and Apache Cordova (PhoneGap). To demonstrate how this new framework might be used, we will script a simple game using SpriteKit, the new built-in 2D game framework in iOS 7.</p>

              <h4>Jordan Rousseau</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Data visualizations of large weather datasets have always been too expensive to render client-side. Commonly used datasets (radar/satellite/rainfall) are run through WDT's image tiling server and served out as x/y/z Mercator tiles. Small point-based or polygon-based datasets are being served out as GeoJSON feeds. Experimental and forecast-based products have always been viewed by static imagery. Our web development team has built leaflet plugins for displaying tile and GeoJSON products, and they have utilized d3.js, leaflet.js to render the raw output of WDT's newest weather products client-side.</p>

            <p>A breakdown of the general architecture that was used for building <a href="http://www.cloudhdr.com">CloudHdr</a>.  The entire system is composed of 3 main "service" apps (users, files, processing), and a collection of various single page apps each aimed at a different vertical slice of user facing functionality.  Topics would include auth from service to service and from SPA to service, cross domain issues for data transfer, and handling file uploads.  JS examples would be in Ember, but concepts would be broadly applicable to other frameworks.  In fact some of the "tricks" are accomplished outside of the framework, with jQuery.</p>

            <p>In this talk I'll cover some of what the Mozilla Web Compat team does, i.e., working towards a truly open web where content is available to all users of the web, independent of device, browser, or country of origin. Along the way we'll look at some truly horrific code ranging from old school clientside UA sniffing to busted HTTP interactions. And hopefully we'll come away with a better understanding of how we can hope to support the ever-growing set of devices accessing our sites and apps.</p>

            <p>Depending on who you ask, HTML5 is either the pinnacle of open technologies, or a telltale reason so many mobile apps suck. After an awkward adolescence, from HTML to XHTML and back again, battle lines have been drawn around this revitalized contender named HTML5. Even supposing a victory is possible, is it winner-take-all? In this talk, we'll look at various approaches to mobile development: from responsive sites, to native apps, and what role HTML5 has to play.</p>
